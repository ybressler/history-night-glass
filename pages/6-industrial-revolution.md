# `We can do better.`
By the 1700s, the rich want bigger, clearer windows to show off their nice houses.

The problem: Glass is still made by hand, pane by laborious pane. It's wavy, bubbly, and expensive.

# `Solution #1: Polished Plate Glass`
`The French invent a new method in the late 1600s.`

1.  `Pour molten glass onto a huge iron table.`
2.  `Roll it flat.`
3.  `Spend days... and days... grinding and polishing both sides.`

`The result: Perfectly clear, flat, flawless glass. But it's so expensive only royalty can afford it (think Palace of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors).`

# Solution #2: `Industrial Cylinder Blowing`
For everyone else, they scale up the old `Cylinder Method`.

* `Bigger furnaces = more heat`
* `Stronger workers = bigger bubbles`
* `Better chemistry = fewer impurities`

This becomes the workhorse method of the 19th century. Panes get bigger, cheaper, and clearer.

# `Window Shopping is Born`
`Suddenly, shops can have huge, clear windows.`

`For the first time, you can see all the goods inside without obstruction. This completely changes retail and city life.`

# `The Sash Window`
A new invention takes over homes.

Two separate, framed panes (`sashes`) that slide vertically. You can open the top and bottom for better air circulation.

`No more propping the window open with a book.`

# `The Crystal Palace`
`In 1851, the British build a convention center for the Great Exhibition.`

`It's a titanic greenhouse made of mass-produced cast iron and nearly 1M! square feet of the newly affordable cylinder-blown sheet glass.`

`The ultimate "more glass than wall."`

# `The Walls Come Down`
In the late 1800s, the steel frame is invented.

The building's skeleton now holds the weight, not the walls. This means the walls can be a thin "curtain" of whatever you want.

`And what everyone wants is glass.`

# `The Chicago Window`
A new style for a new age.

* `Huge central pane for maximum view and light (thanks to plate glass).`
* `Two narrow, openable windows on the sides for ventilation.`

`The perfect blend of a great view and a fresh breeze.`

# The Mic Drop: `Float Glass`
Finally, in the 1950s, the British company Pilkington perfects the modern method.

1.  `Pour molten glass out of the furnace.`
2.  `Float it on a perfectly flat bed of molten tin.`
3.  `The glass spreads out, creating a flawless, uniform sheet.`
4.  `Cool it down.`

`This is how virtually all flat glass is still made today.`
