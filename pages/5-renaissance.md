# `My windows are bigger than yours.`
The new status symbol: A symmetrical `Palazzo` with big, orderly windows.

# The other way to make glass
Besides the `Cylinder Method`, there's the **`Crown Glass Method`**.

* `1. Blow a bubble.`
* `2. Stick it on an iron rod.`
* `3. Get it hot.`
* `4. SPIN IT. Really fast.`

`Creates a big, wavy, glass pizza.`

# The `Belly Button` of Glass
The center of the "crown" where the rod was attached is called a **bullion** or **bull's-eye**.

It's the cheapest part of the glass. If you see a window full of these, it was probably a budget job.

# `Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall.`
In the cold, cloudy north (England), they went nuts for glass to get every last bit of sunlight.

This house, built in the 1590s, was a massive flex of wealth and power.

# How to get "more glass than wall"
You can't make huge panes of glass yet.

So you build a grid with stone posts (**mullions**) and fill it with hundreds of small, diamond-shaped panes (**quarries**) held in lead.

`It's a window made of windows.`
